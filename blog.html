  <h1> Welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <h2>06-07-18:</h2>
        <p>Today has been a pretty average day. I woke up before Simone and decided that it would be a good idea to stand on her with one paw on her face and the other on her shoulder. She didn’t seem all that happy with my attempt to wake her up so I curled back under the covers and waited for her alarm to go off. As soon as it did, Simone hit snooze and tried to go back to sleep, but I couldn’t let that happen. I chose to go with a cuteness tactic: I rolled on top of her on my back and licked her nose and she scratched by ears, success. As soon as she was out of bed I was jumping around excited for my breakfast and morning walk, maybe we’d see some birds or some gophers to chase at the park. After our walk the girls went to school and I was lonely again. I went on another walk with mom and then everyone was gone and I was alone in the house, except for my kittie brother who hissed at me for looking in his direction.
          Suddenly the front door opened and Debbie, my walker came in. She loaded me up in the car with a bunch of my friends and we headed to the dog park for some more playtime. After coming back home and napping for a while, Simone came back and took me on a run. It’s been a good day, I can’t wait for tomorrow.</p>

          <p>I woke up this morning to loud meowing. My brother is such a loudmouth. It’s a Sunday which means that Simone will sleep longer than usual so I have to find a toy to pass the time. Apparently my squeaky toy wasn’t the best choice because on the fifth squeak, Simone was taking it away and crawling back into bed. After another hour of mind dumbing still, Simone finally wakes up to feed me and take me on a walk. As soon as we get home she seems worried though. They leave me in the yard and I hear more meowing from inside. What the heck is my brother up to? All of a sudden, Simone and mom leave with my brother Gogo in the carrier. I’ve been waiting forever for them to come back when they finally walk through the door with a drugged up Gogo. They take him straight up to the bedroom and shut me out with the door. Right now I’m just lying here trying to smell what’s wrong with my brother. Wish me luck.</p>
