<h2>My biography</h2>
    <p>Nobody is all too sure about my young life, but I was rescued by the LA County Animal Control in a pack of dogs who were running away from the fires. Because of the huge amounts of strays that they were finding, I was only in the shelter for 10 days before they put me on the euthanization list. The Milo Foundation from the East Bay knew that all of us great dogs didn’t deserve to die so they came down to LA and brought some of us back to Richmond with them. I hung out at the Point Richmond Milo Foundation center for three days and then a family came and took me out on a walk. They tried to get me to fetch, no luck, why would anyone chase a ball? And we ran around and played at a Park for an hour. Then some lady took me into a room full of cats, apparently they wanted to be sure that I wouldn’t eat my, later-to-be, brother Gogo. I passed the test and before I knew it they were signing some papers and then I was in the car with them driving to where I would later call my home. I love my new pack, they take me on hikes and runs and protect me from scary, barky chihuahuas. Four weeks later I graduated from a puppy obedience class at Berkeley humane, I got a special certificate and everything. I have lots of puppy playdates with all of my friends. I have a lot of friends. Juno is my neighbor and my best friend. Cody is a wheaton terrier and can be kind of scary, but he is my friend. Wywy is my friend and his brother Bently is a teacup poodle who likes to chase me around. My friend Argos just moved back to New York with his owners, but he’s still my friend. I love pretty much everyone that I meet! I love dogs, and people, and cats, and anyone who doesn’t bark at me.<p/>
